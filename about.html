        <h1>About India's Independence Day</h1>
        <p>The country began its struggle for Independence with the Rovolt of 1857. Later, around 1920, the freedom struggle gained momentum under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership. Finally, on July 4, 1947, the British House of Commons introduced the Indian Independence Bill. On August 15, India became an independent nation.</p>
        <p>On the eve of India's Independence, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of Independent India, hailed this historic achievement as a 'Tryst with Destiny'. On August 15, Nehru hoisted the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of Red Fort in Delhi. It is a tradition that every Prime Minister has since followed with an address to the country.</p>
        <p>Independence Day reminds every citizen of the country about the dawn of a new beginning, the freedom struggle, the freedom fighters who laid their lives for the country, and the countless sacrifices they made to achieve liberation from the clutches of Britishers. It is marked as a national holiday in the country.</p>
